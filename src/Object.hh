/**
 * Object is the base class for all "objects" in the world.
 * The most important facilities this class provides are:
 *
 * - A way to clone() and dispose() objects.  This is mainly used
 *     in function MakeObject() to create new objects of a given
 *     type.
 *
 * - A way to pass messages between unrelated objects via message().
 *     This allows us to send messages to objects from Lua and to
 *     decouple objects types as much as possible.
 *
 * - A way to get and set attributes.  These attributes are quite
 *     similar to instance variables, but they can be easily modified
 *     from Lua.  This makes it possible to modify certain object
 *     parameters (such as the text on a piece of paper or the color
 *     of an oxyd stone) in level descriptions.
 *
 * The various Object subclasses instances need to register a template
 * instance for each object name. To avoid the inclusion of every
 * subclass declaration file into the registry for registry driven forward
 * initialization we make use of the static file based initialization
 * that occurs prior to the main application startup. To be independent of
 * the undefined sequence in which the files are initialized we store the
 * template instances, object names and id's in function local static caches.
 * These caches are copied to the final runtime data structures on the main
 * application startup. We call this feature "boot"-initialization. The macros
 * BOOT_REGISTER_START and BOOT_REGISTER_END will be used once at the end of
 * every subclass file. They embrace the BootRegister() function calls that
 * register the templates.
