About Enigma
============

Enigma is a tribute to and a re-implementation of one of the most
original and intriguing computer games of the 1990's: Oxyd.  Your
objective is easily explained: find and uncover all pairs of identical
Oxyd stones in each landscape.  Sounds simple?  It would be, if it
weren't for hidden traps, vast mazes, insurmountable obstacles and
innumerable puzzles blocking your direct way to the Oxyd stones...

Enigma is not nearly finished and help is always appreciated.  If you
enjoy programming, painting, recording sound effects, or designing
levels, you can always join our developers' mailing list at

Playing Enigma
==============

Please refer to the user manual for instructions on how to play Enigma,
or simply start with the tutorial levels included with the game.


Installation
============

Installation on Windows and MacOS X is straightforward: Simply download
the appropriate .exe or .dmg file and start it with a double click.

Things get a little more complicated for other operating systems,
please refer to Enigma's download page

       http://www.nongnu.org/enigma/download.html
       
for up-to-date information.  If you are running some kind Unix system,
you have always the option of compiling Enigma yourself; this is
explained in the next section.

There may or may not be binaries for your Linux distribution of choice,
and they may or may not work on your computer.  This is not our fault:
packaging a Linux version that works everywhere is almost impossible,
thanks to countless subtle and not-so-subtle differences between each
and every Linux distribution.  Please complain to your vendor if this
bugs you.


Compiling Enigma
================

This section briefly describes how to compile Enigma on a Unix machine.
If you are interested in building Enigma on Windows, please see the
documentation in `doc/README.mingw'.

If you want to compile Enigma from source, you must have the following
programs and libraries installed

    * A C++ compiler
    
      GNU C++ 2.95.4, 3.3 and 3.4 are officially supported, older
      versions may not work.  If you use another C++ compiler, your
      mileage may vary.  The Intel C++ compiler used to work, but we
      haven't tested it in a long time.
      
    * SDL >= 1.2 
    
      http://www.libsdl.org
      
    * SDL_mixer >= 1.2.4 
    
      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer
      
    * SDL_image >= 1.2.0 
    
      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image
      
    * SDL_ttf >= 2.0.6 

      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf
    
These should already come with most reasonably up-to-date Linux
distributions, but you may have to install the development packages of
the libraries if you want to compile Enigma from source. 

Installation should now be as easy as typing

    ./configure && make && make install

in the enigma directory.


Copying
=======

Enigma is free software.  You may copy and modify it under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, Version 2 or, at your option, any
later version.  For details, please refer to the accompanying
COPYING.GPL file.

  To my best knowledge the included sound effects are either in the
public domain or freely distributable.  I wasn't able to pin down the
exact origin of each sound file -- the copyrights of which I am aware
are collected in sound/README.  Please refer to this list before using
the samples in your productions.
