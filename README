About Enigma
============

Enigma is a unique puzzle game, with influences from almost every game
genre.  Your objective is easily explained: you control a small black
marble with your mouse and have to find and uncover all pairs of
identical Oxyd stones in each landscape.  Simple? Yes.  Easy? It would
be, if it weren't for hidden traps, vast mazes, insurmountable
obstacles and innumerable puzzles blocking your direct way to the Oxyd
stones... If you like puzzle games and have a steady hand, Enigma's
more than 1500 levels will probably keep you busy for hours on end.

Enigma is developed by a small group of volunteers, and help is always
appreciated.  If you like Enigma and want to contribute to its future,
you are welcome to join us on our development mailing list at

Playing Enigma
==============

Please refer to the user manual for instructions on how to play Enigma,
or simply start with the tutorial levels included with the game.


Installation
============

Installation on Windows and Mac OS X is straightforward: Simply download
the appropriate .exe or .dmg file and start it with a double click.

Things get a little more complicated for other operating systems,
please refer to Enigma's download page

       http://www.nongnu.org/enigma/download.html
       
for up-to-date information.  If you are running some kind of Unix system,
you have always the option of compiling Enigma yourself; this is
explained in the next section.

There may or may not be binaries for the Linux distribution of your choice,
and they may or may not work on your computer.  This is not our fault:
packaging a Linux version that works everywhere is almost impossible,
thanks to countless subtle and not-so-subtle differences between each
and every Linux distribution.  Please complain to your vendor if this
bugs you.


Compiling Enigma
================

This section briefly describes how to compile Enigma on a Unix
machine.  If you want to build Enigma on Windows or Mac OS X, please
see the documentation in `doc/README.mingw32' and `doc/README.macosx',
respectively.

For a list of libraries and programs that must be installed to compile
Enigma, please refer to `doc/REQUIREMENTS' for a complete list.

Once you have everything installed, building Enigma is as easy as typing

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

in the enigma directory.

of the GNU General Public License, Version 2 or, at your option, any
