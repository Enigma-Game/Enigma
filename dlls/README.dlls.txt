OpenSSL

Copyright (c) 1995-2021 The OpenSSL Project Authors. All Rights Reserved.
Copyright (c) 2005 Nokia. All rights reserved.

OpenSSL is covered by one of two licenses, depending on which release is involved.

For the 3.0.0 release, and later releases derived from that, the Apache License v2 applies. This also applies to the git "master" branch.
see: LICENSE.Apache-2.0.txt

For any release made before OpenSSL 3.0.0 (namely the 1.1.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.2, and all prior releases including those not currently supported), the dual OpenSSL and SSLeay license applies. Note that this is also true for any updates to those releases -- the "letter suffix" -- no matter when they are made. It also applies to the git branches for all those releases, and to any public forks that have not rebased to master (or 3.0.0).
