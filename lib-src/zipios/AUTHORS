The files zipios++/directory.h and zipios++/directory.cpp originate
from the dir_it library written by Dietmar Kuehl (it's available for
download at http://www.boost.org)

contrib/zipios++.spec.in contributed by Rui Miguel Silva Seabra

libtool/shared library patch contributed by Arkadiusz Miskiewicz (arekm)

Russel Winder (was r.winder@180sw.com, now russel@winder.org.uk) did the work
of amending the code so as to work with GCC 3.2.1.

Ross Burton (was r.burton@180sw.com, now ...) transformed zipios++.spec into
zipios++.spec.in and made it more RedHat tradition conformant.

Mark Donszelmann (Mark.Donszelmann@slac.stanford.edu) added gzipoutputstream
and made several fixes for Visual C++ 6.0 and 7.0.

Alexis Wilke converted version 1.x to 2.x and made it C++11 compatible.
The API changed fairly heavily to comply with newer C++ versions.
