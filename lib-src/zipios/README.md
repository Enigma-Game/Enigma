# Introduction

Zipios is a small C++ library for reading and writing zip files. The
structure and public interface are based (somewhat loosely) on the
`java.util.zip` package. The streams created to access the individual
entries in a zip file are based on the standard iostream library.

Zipios also provides a way for an application to support files from
multiple sources (e.g. from zip files or from ordinary directories)
transparently.

The source code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL).


# Important Note

I renamed the root branch as "main" instead of "master". If you created
a fork or wanted to clone the project, make sure to use "main" now.


# Dependencies

Requires **zlib** ([https://zlib.net](https://zlib.net/)).

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install zlib-dev

    # Fedora/RPM based systems
    sudo dnf install zlib-devel

To run the automatic unit test suite you need **Catch**
([https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2))

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install catch

    # Fedora/RPM based systems
    sudo dnf install catch-devel

The tests also require the *zip* command line tool.

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install zip

    # Fedora/RPM based systems
    sudo dnf install zip

To build the projects, we use a C++ compiler (tested with **g++** and
**clang**) as well as **cmake**.

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install g++
    sudo apt-get install cmake

    # Fedora/RPM based systems
    sudo dnf install gcc-c++
    sudo dnf install cmake

By default, the CMakeLists.txt knows to skip building the documentation.
This happens if `doxygen` and `graphviz` are not both installed.

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz

    # Fedora/RPM based systems
    sudo dnf install doxygen graphviz


# Installation

This version of the software uses `cmake` to generate the necessary make
files or solutions and projects under MS-Windows.

The following options are supported:

    - `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` (ON by default)
    - `BUILD_DOCUMENTATION` (ON by default)
    - `zipios_project_COVERAGE` (OFF by default)
    - `BUILD_ZIPIOS_TESTS` (ON by default)

In order to build Zipios as a static library, specify:

    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF

In order to explicitly disable building Doxygen documentation, specify:

    -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION:BOOL=OFF

In order to build the library with coverage support, use the coverage
option and make sure to compile in Debug mode too:

    -Dzipios_project_COVERAGE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

By default tests get built if catch.hpp is available. However, you may
have catch.hpp installed on your system but want to skip on building
the tests (i.e. nightly build). In that case you may turn them off with:

    -DBUILD_ZIPIOS_TESTS:BOOL=OFF


## Unix

Once you have `cmake` installed, you should be able to run the following
under Unix:

    tar xf zipios.tar.gz
    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD
    cmake ../zipios
    make
    make install

_(See the `zipios/dev/build` script for an example script.)_

The project comes with a build script (see `dev/build`) that can be used
to run those steps. It will assume that you do not mind to have your `BUILD`
directory blown away and rebuilds everything. It also may setup various
flags on the command line to build the `DEBUG` version, for example.

If you make changes to the source tree, you may re-run the make from the
source tree with something like:

    make -C ../BUILD

For details about available installation configurations of cmake packages
refer to the CMake documentation online
[https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)

By default, `make install` installs the Zipios 2.1+ header files under
`/usr/include/zipios/` and the library `libzipios.so` under `/usr/lib/`.
You can choose another base path than `/usr/` using the following option
on the `cmake` command line:

    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/alexis/zipios

The build script actually installs everything under `BUILD/dist` so one
can verify the results and package them before shipping.

Running `make` also builds one test program. It can be found in the tests
directory in your `BUILD` folder. It is one program that actually runs
many tests. (It is possible to run one test at a time, see the script
under `dev/check` for an example.)


## Windows

CMake comes with a graphical tool one can use under MS-Windows to
configure and generate a project supporting cmake. You will find more
information about cmake on their official website
[https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org).

The output of CMake can be projects and a solution for Visual Studio C++
or a set of `nmake` files. cmake also supports other formats such as JOM.

Once the cmake output was generated, you can run your build tools and
then run the `INSTALL` target. That will install the binary files in
one place.

It is strongly advise that your define the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
variable before you install anything.


# Status and Documentation

Please refer to the online documentation at
[https://zipios.sourceforge.io](https://zipios.sourceforge.io)

At this time, we generate the HTML and Latex version of the documentation.
It is pretty big, but we'll do our best to offer a .tar.gz of the
documentation on SourceForge.io each time we offer a new version of
the library.

If you have Doxygen installed, then the documentation will automatically
be generated. Note that under MS-Windows you may have to specify a
path for cmake to find Doxygen and properly generate the output. The
setup makes use of dot to generate images showing relationships between
classes and files.
