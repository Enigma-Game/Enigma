/** \class FileCollection
 * \brief Base class for various file collections.
 *

 * represents different origins of file collections, such as
 * directories, simple filename lists and compressed archives.
 */


/** \typedef std::shared_ptr<std::istream> FileCollection::stream_pointer_t;
 * \brief A shared pointer to an input stream.
 *
 * This type of pointer is used whenever you retrieve an input stream
 * from a file collection such as the ZipFile class. Having shared
 * pointers ensures that the pointers can be shared between various
 * functions and it gets deleted in the end.
 */


/** \fn stream_pointer_t FileCollection::getInputStream(std::string const & entry_name, MatchPath matchpath = MatchPath::MATCH);
 * \brief Retrieve pointer to an istream.
 *
 * This function returns a shared pointer to an istream defined from the
 * named entry which is expected to be available in this collection.
 *
 * The function returns a NULL pointer if there is no entry with the
 * specified name in this FileCollection.
 *
 * Note that the function returns a smart pointer to an istream. In
 * general the FileCollection will not hold that pointer meaning that
 * if you call getInputStream() multiple times with the same
 * \p entry_name parameter, you get distinct istream instances each
 * time.
 *
 * By default the \p entry_name parameter is expected to match the full
 * path and filename (MatchPath::MATCH). If you are looking for a file
 * and want to ignore the directory name, set the matchpath parameter
 * to MatchPath::IGNORE.
 *
 * \warning
 * In version 1.0 there was a version of the function accepting a
 * FileEntry instead of a filename. That function was simply calling
 * this function with file_entry->getName() and MatchPath::MATCH so
 * you can convert the call with:
 *
 * \code
 *      // old code:
 *      ConstEntryPointer ent = zf.getEntry("file2.txt", FileCollection::IGNORE);
 *      if(ent)
 *      {
 *          auto_ptr<istream> is(getInputStream(ent));
 *          if(is)
 *          {
 *              // got access to the file in the archive
 *              ...
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      // new code:
 *      zipios::FileEntry::pointer_t ent(zf.getEntry(argv[2], zipios::FileCollection::MatchPath::IGNORE));
 *      if(ent)
 *      {
 *          zipios::ZipFile::stream_pointer_t is(zf.getInputStream(ent->getName()));

 *              // got access to the file in the archive
 *              ...
 *          }
 *      }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par
 * There are two reasons for the change: (1) the function really just called
 * the other with getName() and thus there was no reason to have two
 * functions; and (2) the function did NOT test whether the entry was one
 * that this collection owned making it feel like you could call the
 * getInputStream() function of collection A with entry of collection B
 * and still get a valid stream.
 *
 * \param[in] entry_name  The name of the file to search in the collection.
 * \param[in] matchpath  Whether the full path or just the filename is matched.
