 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Zipios is a java.util.zip-like C++ library for reading and
 * writing Zip files (ZipFile). Access to individual entries is
 * provided through a Zipios class (FileEntry) for the meta data
 * of the and a standard C++ iostreams for the contents of the file.
 *
 * A simple virtual file system that mounts regular directories and
 * zip files is also provided (FileCollection).
 *
 * The library is fully re-entrant. It is not otherwise thread safe.
 *
 * The source code is released under the <a
 * href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
 * License</a>.
 *
 * \section status Status
 *
 * This was the status of version 1.x. At this point, 2.x has a brand new
 * version out and we are waiting for good news about the current status.
 * That being said, version 2.x comes a test suite which produces a
 * 100% coverage of the library (except gzip which is not yet publicly
 * available.)
 *
 * \warning
 * There is a bug in the catch.hpp header file that generates a never
 * ending loop (see https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/issues/271 for
 * more information) when running the test suite under FreeBSD and an error
 * occurs (although you should not have an error, if it happens, then
 * the loop never ends.) I have noticed that problem with the following
 * scenario, and it does not seem to be fixed yet (Apr 4, 2015):
 *
 * \li "use Zipios to create zip archives with 1 or 3 files each"
 *
 * Spanned archives are not supported, and support is not planned.
 *
 * The library v1.x has been tested and appears to be working with:
 *
 * \li <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/archivers.html#zipios++-0.1.5">FreeBSD stable and current / gcc 2.95.3</a>
 * \li Red Hat Linux release 7.0  / gcc 2.96
 * \li Red Hat Linux release 6.2 (Zoot) / egcs-2.91.66
 * \li Linux Mandrake release 7.0 (Air) / gcc 2.95.2
 * \li SGI IRIX64 6.5 / gcc 2.95.2
 * \li SGI IRIX64 6.5 / MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.30
 *
 * The library v2.x has been compiled and appears to be working with:
 *
 * \li Ubuntu (starting with 14.04) -- full test suite working
 * \li Debian (starting with Stretch)
 * \li Fedora (starting with F25)
 * \li FreeBSD (starting with 10.01)
 * \li SunOS (starting with Open SunOS 11.2)
 * \li Cygwin (starting with 6.1)
 *
 * If you make Zipios work on other platforms, let us know by posting
 * an issue on GitHub:
 *
 *    https://github.com/Zipios/Zipios/issues
 *
 *
 * \section documentation Documentation
 *
 * This web page is the front page to the library documentation which
 * is generated from the source files using <a
 * href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html">Doxygen</a>.
 * Use the links at the top of the page to browse the API
 * documentation. Your Doxygen installation may also be capable
 * of generating other formats (Latex, PDF, etc.) if you would
 * prefer such (we only offer the HTML documentation.)
 *
 * \subsection zipfiles Zip file access
 *
 * The two most important classes are DirectoryCollection and ZipFile.
 *
 * A ZipFile is also a FileCollection, only the collection is loaded
 * from a Zip archive instead of a directory. A ZipFile is composed of
 * ZipCentralDirectoryEntry objects. As far as you are concerned though,
 * you can only use it as FileEntry objects.
 *
 * Note that the ZipFile constructor immediately scans the Central
 * Directory of the Zip archive so the entries are immediately accessible.
 *
 * The DirectoryCollection can be created one file at a time, so it is
 * possible to create a collection without having to include all the
 * files from a directory. However, the files still have to exist on
 * disk. The DirectoryCollection is composed of DirectoryEntry objects.
 *
 * To access the entries in a collection, use the entries() function
 * which returns a vector of FileEntry objects. If you know the exact
 * filename of an entry, you may also use the getEntry() with that name.
 * This is particularly useful if you want to use Zipios as a way to
 * handle the resources of your executable (see the openEmbeddedZipFile()
 * function and the appendzip.cpp tool). Finally, you want to use
 * the getInputStream() function to read the data of a file defined in
 * a collection.
 *
 * \code
 *      // Resources global pointer
 *      zipios::ZipFile::pointer_t g_resources;
 *
 *      // Initialization of resources
 *      g_resources = zipios::ZipFile::openEmbeddedZipFile("executable_filename");
 *
 *      // Anywhere else in your application
 *
 *      // 1. get the entry (to access meta data)
 *      zipios::FileEntry::pointer_t entry(g_resources->getEntry("my/resource/file.xml"));
 *
 *      // 2. get the istream (to access the actual file data)
 *      zipios::FileCollection::stream_pointer_t in_stream(g_resources->getInputStream("my/resource/file.xml"));
 * \endcode
 *
 * zipios_example.cpp demonstrates the central elements of Zipios when used
 * in read mode.
 *
 * \subsection filecollection FileCollection
 *
 * A ZipFile is actually just a special kind of FileCollection that
 * obtains its entries from a Zip archive. Zipios also implements
 * a DirectoryCollection that obtains its entries from an on disk
 * directory and a CollectionCollection that obtains its entries from
 * other collections.
 *
 * Using a single CollectionCollection, any number of other FileCollection's
 * can be placed under its control and accessed through the same single
 * interface that is used to access a ZipFile or a DirectoryCollection.
 *
 * \warning
 * The CollectionCollection singleton in version 1.x was removed to make
 * the entire library 100% re-entrant without the need to link against
 * a thread library.
 *
 * \section download Download
 *
 * The <a href="https://github.com/Zipios/Zipios">Zipios project</a> is now
 * on github. You can find the source files, tarballs and changelog files
 * there.
 *
 * \section development Development
 *
 * The Zipios project makes use of a few development tools and the
 * tests require the zip utility, used to verify that an external tool
 * can generate a zip file that Zipios can read.
 *
 * Under a Debian or Ubuntu system, you can run apt-get install with
 * the following list of packages:
 *
 * \code
 *   # For source management (or download the .tar.gz file)
 *   apt-get install git
 *
 *   # For development
 *   apt-get install g++ cmake zlib1g-dev
 *
 *   # For documentation (or download the -doc.tar.gz file)
 *   apt-get install doxygen graphviz
 *
 *   # For testing (optional, albeit recommended)
 *   apt-get install catch zip
 * \endcode
 *
 * Under Fedora, you can use dnf (or yum for early versions):
 *
 * \code
 *   # For source management (or download the .tar.gz file)
 *   dnf install git
 *
 *   # For development
 *   dnf install gcc-c++ cmake zlib-devel
 *
 *   # For documentation (or download the -doc.tar.gz file)
 *   dnf install doxygen graphviz
 *
 *   # For testing (optional, albeit recommended)
 *   dnf install catch-devel zip
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * Other systems use tools with pretty much the same naming convention
 * so you should be able to make the correlation.
 *
 * \section history History
 *
 * <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>.
 * The compression library that Zipios uses to perform the actual
 * compression and decompression.
 *
 * Zipios version 1.0 is heavily inspired by the java.util.zip package.
 * Version 2.0 is following the same philosophy without (1) attempting
 * to follow the interface one to one and (2) without updating to the
 * newer version, if there were changes...
 *
 * You will find a text file in the doc directory named zip-format.txt
 * with a complete description of the zip file format as of October 1, 2014.
