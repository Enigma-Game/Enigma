Release notes for Zipios 2.2.0
--------------------------------

As per [issue #28 on Github](https://github.com/Zipios/Zipios/issues/28),
there was a discrepancy in licenses because of the dostime.c and dostime.h
files.

These two files were removed and replaced by a DOSDateTime class instead.
It's all C++ and uses a structure with field to convert the data as required.

The license was also updated and copyright file fixed up to match the newer
version.

Release notes for Zipios 2.1.0
--------------------------------

Moving the header files from /usr/include/zipios++ to /usr/include/zipios
which is a more conventional name for a directory.

Various fixes such as copyright notices, zipios_tool renamed, manual
pages.

HEAD of CVS

  - Correction added for Visual C++ 7.1
  - Further support for CppUnit.
  - Makefile.vc5 renamed to Makefile.vc

API changes:
  - ZipInputStream::getNextEntry() must be called before accessing first entry



Release notes for Zipios++ 0.1.5
--------------------------------
New features:
  - Support for Visual C++ 6
  - VFS feature finished
  - Support for writing zip archives (pre-beta!)

Bug fixes:
  - Code reorganized and many minor bug fixes

Changes:
  - flex/lex is no longer required



Release notes for Zipios++ 0.1.4
--------------------------------
Bug fixes: 
  - A bug in a code fragment used in all the test programs for copying
    data from an istream to an ostream has been fixed
  - A nasty and embarrassing bug in ZipInputStreambuf and
    InflateInputStreambuf that prevented zip entries containing the character
    255 from being correctly decompressed has been fixed



Release notes for Zipios++ 0.1.3
--------------------------------
Changes:
  - Changed the license to GNU Lesser General Public License



Release notes for Zipios++ 0.1.2
--------------------------------
New features:
  - ZipFile can now be used to read zip files embedded in other files. The
    static method ZipFile::openEmbeddedZipFile() can be used to open zip 
    files embedded in another file with the binary appendzip, which is 
    also part of the Zipios++ distribution


Bug fixes:
  Installation:
   - Header files are now installed (under (usr/include/)zipios++/)
   - The library libzipios.a is now installed
   - The test binaries are no longer installed
   - Renamed config.h to zipios-config.h to avoid file name collisions

  Building:
   - Added a switch --with-std-compliant-iostream (and --without-...) 
     to the configure script, such that the library can be build against 
     the old iostream.h library, even if a newer std compliant iostream 
     implementation is available in iostream

  Source:
   - Most functions now throw exceptions (reflected in the documentation)
     instead of printing error messages to stderr
   - Fixes to make the library compile and work with gcc 2.95.2


Missing features and known bugs:
  - DirectoryCollection::entries() end DirectoryCollection::size() are
    not implemented yet
